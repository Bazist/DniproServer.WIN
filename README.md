# DniproServer

**DniproDB** one of the fastest document oriented database in the world. The database has innovated core based on Trie structures, Inverted indexes and Lock Free algorithms.

# Why Dnipro ?
## REALLY EASY SYNTAX

Syntax so important for daily using.
Just put hierarchy of your bigest **Business Object** to database in one row

```C#
db.AddDoc(obj);
```
And that's all ! We indexed the object by all attributes and save it in convinient JSON format.

**Link queries** helps build complex queries

```C#
User[] users = 
db.GetWhere("{'FirstName':'John'})")
  .AndWhere("{'Address':{'Country':'UK'}})"
	  .Select<User>("{'FirstName':$,'LastName':$}");
```

And, of course, perfect **JOIN** ...
```C#
JoinResult[] jrs =
db.GetWhere("{'FirstName':'John'}")
  .Join("{'CarModel':$}","{'Type':'Car', 'Model':$}")
  .Join("{'Company':$}","{'Type':'Company', 'Name':$}")
  .Select<JoinResult>
         ("{'FirstName':$}{'Engine':$}{'City':$}");
```
Few clicks by mouse and database is ready for using in your environment now (Ready for Win platform and .NET, Java providers)

## So fast

Speed, speed and again speed.
Database based on very fast **Trie** structures, **Lock Free** algorithms and we reinvented standard approaches in core 
to store JSONs only as set of keys.
So 
* When you insert a document, you just insert keys to Key\Value storage.
* When you update an attribute in document, you just update key in the storage.
* When you insert an attribute in document, you just insert new key in the storage, without any overwriting of document.
* When you select part of document, you just lookup several keys

And ... what you should know ... one operation of insert/update/lookup of long key in storage costs about **fifty nanoseconds*
on core level ...
In regular benchmarks **Dnipro** faster than standard databases in [ten](http://forum.pikosec.com/viewforum.php?f=7) times and more.

Run in console **db.SelfTest()** to see how many seconds need to your computer to finish 
more than ten millions queries in our benchmark.

## Reliable database

Without any compromises.
**ACID** and three types of **Transactions** (ReadCommited, RepeatableRead, Snapshot).
Very carefully blocking. Blocking only on **attribute level**.
It gives maximum parallelism. Many transactions can change one document at the same time. 
If changing attributes are not crossed, they changes without conflicts to each other. 
They wouldnâ€™t overwrite changes to each other.
**Resolve any deadlocks** with full information in log: who, when, what documents, what attributes

And now it's Opensource.
Enjoy !
